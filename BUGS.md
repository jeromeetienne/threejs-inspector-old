- FIXME should deselect if click on empty part of treeView
- FIXME sometime the treeview doesnt reflect the selected object

---
- FIXED bounding sphere center can be modified
- FIXED auto refresh setting not stored
- FIXED material is pushing bad properties in injected material
  - check if the field is visible before
- FIXED tab material doesnt keep active
  - select an object3d with material
  - go to an object without material
  - come back in the object3d with material
  - BUG: nothing is shown, not material nor object3d
- FIXED if change in material type, the UI isnt updated
  - maybe to trigger a UISelect()
- FIXED what happen if we delete the selected ?
