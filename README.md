# Three.js Inspector
three.js inspector is an extension for chrome devtool. It allows you to inspect
the three.js scene in a web page. 
You can install [three.js Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threejs-inspector/dnhjfclbfhcbcdfpjaeacomhbdfjbebi)

It is a fork from
[WebGL GLSL Shader Editor Extension for Google Chrome](https://github.com/spite/ShaderEditorExtension)
by the excelent @thespite. Check it out!
